  "ABOUT": "About",
"ABOUT_TEXT": "I am Sofia, the author and founder of Briolin Barber Blog. My journey in the world of beauty began with work in the hairdressing industry, where I also had the opportunity to try myself as a barber. This experience gave me an understanding of how important barbershop culture, the professionalism of masters, and a quality approach to men's style are.",
"ABOUT_TEXT2": "Briolin Barber Blog was created to become a platform for sharing knowledge, inspiration, and experience among barbers, clients, and everyone interested in modern men's haircuts, beard care, tools, trends, and stories from the life of barbershops. I strive for this blog to be not only a source of useful information but also a place for communication, support, and the development of the barber community.",
"ABOUT_TEXT3": "This blog is not just about haircuts and beard care. It's about style and self-expression. I believe that every barber can become an artist, and every client can be a part of this culture. Join us, share your stories, experiences, and inspiration. Together, we will create something special!"
